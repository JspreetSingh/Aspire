        <h5>What are the Aspire Awards ?</h5>
        <p>The Adpire Awards are a new premier annual global award program for Publicis Sapient.</p>
        <p>The awards seek to elevate the Publicis Sapient people who exemplify extraordinary leadership, setting the bar for excellence and difining our future.These role models inspire us to be the best versions of ourselves, and by celebrating them, we reinforce positive example of aspirational leadership in action.</p>
        <p>Part of what makes the Aspire Awards unique is that winner are selected by Publicis Sapient's CEO and as part of the award are invited to join their fellow winners and their families on an all-expense paid trip where they will celebrate this milestone moment in their leadership journeys, hosted by our CEO and three members of the PS Leadership Team.</p>

        <p>Just as anyone can step into the role of aspirational leader, anyone at any level or role at the company, from Junior Associate up to VP, can be nominated to win this award. Nominees need only to be full-time employeeswho have completed at least one year of tenure with our company Members of our Global Leadership Team are not eligible to be nominated.</p>
        <p>There will be 15 winners, all of whom should be top performers who represent who we are at our very best, embodying our Core Values every day and showing what it means to help people thrive in the brave pursuit of next.</p>
        <p>One way the Aspire Awards differ from other award program is that all winners must be nominated by a team of two to four people who collaborate on a joint nomination.
